He joined the Department of Justice as a Prosecutor at the Naples Magistrate Court in 1978. He practiced as an advocate of the High Court until 1982 when he joined Applied Justice Law Firm as a partner. Piet specializes in criminal law, with experience on both the defense and prosecution side. He has achieved the right to appear in the highest courts in the country. A privilege which has allowed him to successfully argue several matters in the Supreme Court of Appeal. Away from work, Piet is a keen mountain biker and red wine connoisseur. Piet is a firm believer that if you have more than one bottle of wine left on the day you die, you are guilty of bad planning.',
